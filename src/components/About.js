        I am a results driven and problem solving programmer looking to start my
        career in software development. During a successful career in content
        delivery and management, I discovered my passion for programming when
        using Python to create a script that automated a previously
        time-intensive task for my team. I found the process of learning to code and execute the script to be both hugely rewarding and satisfying.
        <br />
        <br />
        Something clicked.
        <br />
        <br />
        From this point on I realised programming was something that I wanted to
        pursue. For over a year I have been developing my technical abilities
        and knowledge at every opportunity outside of my working hours. I have been meticulously following an online curriculum called The Odin Project, which provides both the resources and community in order to become a highly skilled developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has been an extremely enjoyable process; I relish the tough
        challenges caused by a problem, followed by the high that comes from
        solving them and the fact that there will always be something new to
        learn.
